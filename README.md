## **Abstract** 
This Rope climbing bot is used to climb ropes in an easy and efficient manner to reduce manual labour.Motorised rollers are used for climbing and a leadscrew is used for the gripping.

## **Motivation**
Peolpe from various fields like mining , miltary , or other often come across situations where they can not get direct access to certain area say inside a cave in a mine . 
There was a need of rope climbing robot which uses a single rope and can reach easily to any desired place in any terrain and most of the robots we come across uses double and are difficult to use. Also many day to day households work can be done easily with a rope climbing robot and thus we need a robot which can used in daily lives .

## **Mechanical aspect**
After gripping the rope firmly, the bot has to climb the rope . The basic pprincipal used along the rope is rolling. <br>
The design consists of a DC motor which is connected to three spur gear asssembly . The end gears are connected to each wheel . The design consists of two wheel pairs on either side of the rope. <br> 
the wheels rolls on the surface of the rope which is powered by a DC motor (motor should provide high torque and power). In presence of sufficient friction between the wheels and the rope . The robot tranveses the rope . The wheel should offer sufficient friction to support the robot in the vertical position . <br>
The other way to arrange the wheels is in a zig-zag pattern which increases the area of contact which in turn increases the friction.<br>
Let the radius of the wheel be r and θ is the angle of contact and h is the rope thickness. The surface area S in contact with the wheel is given as <br>
S = (2πrhθ)/360

## **Electronic aspect**
- Electronic Components used
 1. Arduino Uno 
 2. dc motors 
 3. Ultrasonic distance sensors 
 4. Encoder 
 5. L298n motor controller
 6. Battery 
 7. Connecting wires and jumpers 

- Total two dc motors were used. One to grab the rope with the help of an encoder and the second for climbing the rope.
- Two ultrasonic distance sensors were used to measure the distance of the bot from the floor and the top end of the rope. 
- dc motors were powered through Li-Po 12V dc battery.

## **Applications**

Robot is planned to serve the following tasks:

- It can be used to carry weights or to drop weights from some height.

- When equipped with camera, the robot can be used for surveillence

- When equipped with cleaners, it can be used to clean glasses of windows or walls.

- Robot can be used to take pictures or to make videos from different heights.

## **Limitations**
- The rope can not climb horizontal ropes or ropes at some angel
- The bot can not rope having some obstacles like knots or bend
