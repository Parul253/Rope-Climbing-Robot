## **Motivation**
Peolpe from various fields like mining , miltary , or other often come across situations where they can not get direct access to certain area say inside a cave in a mine . 
Unlike any other rope climbing robot , there was a need of rope climbing robot which uses a single rope and can reach easily to any desired place in any terrain.

Also many day to day households work can be done easily with a rope climbing robot and thus we need a robot which can used in daily lives .
